Don’t let it bring you down.
It’s not the smoke
from funeral pyres,
not crematorium deposit
on childhood games,
not another city burning,
not here, not tonight
though someone whispers
all fires are the fire.
Name of this poem is Crematorium Burning.
It’s not oil flares
not a red dwarf
tracked from the observatory,
not the sfumato
of Last Judgements;
just another done
day rolled to the furnace
in best sunset pinks and blues,
just another deathbed conversion
to the quattrocento.
